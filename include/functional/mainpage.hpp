 * @mainpage Functional programming in C++
 *
 * @section intro Why
 *
 * The purpose of this library is to exercise an approach to functional programming in C++ on top of 
 * the existing `std` C++ vocabulary types (such as `std::expected` and `std::optional`), with the aim 
 * of eventually extending the future versions of the C++ standard library with the functionality found to work well.
